        The <i className="fw-bold">Undercover</i> Game is a social deduction party game where players take on the roles of either civilians or an undercover agent (UC). Each player receives a word or phrase, but the UC's word is different from the civilians. The objective for the civilians is to identify the UC by explaining their word to the group one by one, while the UC attempts to blend in and avoid detection.

      <h6 className='fw-bold'>Gameplay Mechanics:</h6>
      <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Setup:</b> Players are randomly assigned rolesâ€” most are civilians with the same word, while one is the UC with a different word.
        </li>
        <li className="mt-2">
            <b>Explaining Words:</b> Players take turns explaining their word without directly using it, while trying to provide clues that help others guess their identity.
        </li>
        <li className="mt-2">
            <b>Discussion:</b> Players can discuss and analyze each other's explanations to determine who they believe is the UC.
        </li>
        <li className="mt-2">
            <b>Voting: </b> After all players have explained their words, a vote is held to identify the UC. If the UC is correctly identified, civilians win; if not, the UC wins.
        </li>
      </ol>
